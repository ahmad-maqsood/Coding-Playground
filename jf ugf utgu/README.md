# Random-Business-Name-Generator-Using-JS
A three-words random name generator

How it works? A random number is generated before choosing each word. And using if-else-if structure, names are picked and then printed together in the end.

How to run? You can directly run the .js file in your code editor or open the .html file, right click and go to inspect and then to console, there you'll see the name. Refresh the page and the name will change each time.
