# 🛝 Coding Playground

A personal repository of small projects, experiments, and practice code — built incrementally across **any language, framework, or tool** I'm learning at any given time.

> This repo has no fixed scope, no fixed language, and no finish line. It grows as I grow.

## 📌 What This Is

This is not a single application. It's a **developer sandbox** — a place to build things while learning, test ideas without overengineering, and keep all practice work in one version-controlled place.

Every project here exists because it taught me something.

---

## 🗂️ How It's Organized

Each project lives in its **own self-contained folder**. Folder names follow the pattern:

```
LANGUAGE/TECH  Project Name/
```

Examples:
```
JS Counter Program/
PY Snake Water Gun Game/
HTML-CSS Netflix Clone/
CPP Learning Management System/
```

> Whatever language comes next, it follows the same pattern. The repo self-organizes.

Each folder contains its own source files and, where relevant, its own `README.md` with run instructions specific to that project.

## 🚀 Running Any Project

Since projects span different languages, here's a general reference:

| Type | How to Run |
|------|-----------|
| HTML / CSS / JS | Open `index.html` in a browser — no build step needed |
| Python | `python script.py` — check the folder README for any dependencies |
| C++ | `g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp -o out && ./out` |
| Anything else | Check that folder's own `README.md` |

## 🧭 Purpose & Philosophy

- **Breadth over depth** — touch many things, figure out what to go deep on later
- **Done > perfect** — projects are small and functional, not polished products
- **Learning in public** — code quality reflects where I was when I wrote it
- **No gatekeeping** — any language, any concept, anything worth building goes here

---

## 🔭 What's Coming

No fixed roadmap — additions depend on what I'm learning at any point in time.

Possible directions:
- New languages as they come up in coursework or personal interest
- Progressively more complex projects within familiar languages
- Refactors of older projects as skills improve
- Larger scoped projects as fundamentals solidify
