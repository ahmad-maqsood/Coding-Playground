# Coding Playground

A personal coding playground containing small projects, experiments, and practice code.

This repository is meant to be **incremental and flexible**. Projects will be added over time as part of learning, testing ideas, and exploring different concepts in programming.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Practice programming concepts in a hands-on way  
- Experiment with small ideas without overengineering  
- Keep learning projects organized in one place  
- Track personal progress over time  

This is **not** a single application or library. Think of it as a sandbox.

---

## Structure

- Each project or experiment lives in its **own folder**
- Projects are generally small and self-contained
- There is no fixed language or framework restriction

Folder names are intended to be self-explanatory.

---

## Technologies

This repository may include projects using:
- Different programming languages
- Basic algorithms and logic
- Small utilities or demos
- Coursework or self-learning experiments

The tech stack may grow over time.

---

## Status

This repository is **actively evolving**.  
New projects will be added as learning continues.

---

## Notes

- Code quality may vary between projects
- Some projects are intentionally simple
- Improvements and refactoring may happen later
